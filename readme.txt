Realpress turns a Wordpress CMS in to a powerful and attractive real estate web site.

== Description ==

Realpress is an advanced listing tool for the real estate industry.

Realpress uses a unique method to allow real estate listings to be added to wordpress posts using a simple shortcode. Realpress makes additions to the database to control listings details and displays an attractive front end interface by allowing the user to select display options from a choice of sub themes, which include an advanced java drop down page. More themes will be added as we extend the plugin further.

Additional advanced search and feature property widgets will be released in the near future.

Some key features:

 + Full internationalisation via language files
 + Attractive image flash slideshows
 + Fully searchable database
 + Front end listing layout is highly flexible and both the layout and the font-styles/colors can be set in the plugin interface.
 + Google map integration and easy location setting. No need for Geo Locations to be entered.
